# ðŸ“š Content-Based Recommender System

This project builds a recommendation system using content-based filtering. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to recommend items based on a user's interaction history.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- TF-IDF vectorizer to extract text features
- Cosine similarity to measure item similarity
- Custom recommendation class to return personalized suggestions
- Verbose mode to print ranked recommendations

---

## ðŸ§ª How It Works
1. Text data is vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`
2. A user profile is generated from previously interacted items
3. Recommendations are generated using cosine similarity
